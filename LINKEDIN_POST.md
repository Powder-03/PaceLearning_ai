## Post

🚀 **Exciting updates just shipped for DocLearn – my AI-powered personalised learning platform!**

Here's what's new this week 👇

---

⚡ **New Feature: Quick Mode (Quick Chat / Quick Learn)**

Sometimes you don't need a full multi-day study plan — you just want to understand *one thing, right now*.

That's exactly what **Quick Mode** solves.

Pick a topic, set a target (e.g. *"understand async/await in Python"*), choose how much time you have (15 min → 2 hours), and jump straight into an AI-powered one-shot learning session. No lesson planning, no waiting — just instant, focused learning.

Perfect for:
✅ Quick revision before an exam
✅ Learning a small concept on the fly
✅ Exploring a new topic without commitment

The whole session lives in a single chat, with ⚡ indicators throughout the UI so you always know you're in Quick Mode.

🐛 **Bug Fix: Mobile View**

The app was not usable on smaller screens — sidebars were overflowing and navigation was broken on mobile.

This is now fully fixed:
📱 Sticky mobile header with a hamburger menu
📱 Slide-in sidebar overlay on mobile with a tap-to-dismiss backdrop
📱 Responsive chat bubbles and padding that adapt from mobile to desktop
📱 Left & right panel toggles work seamlessly on touch devices

DocLearn now works properly on your phone — whether you're revising on the go or learning during your commute.

Both updates are live in the main repo. If you've been following the project, give it a try and let me know what you think! 🙌
